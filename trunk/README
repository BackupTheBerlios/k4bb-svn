-- Installation --

To install k4 BB, upload the 'upload' folder found in the file/folder
that you downloaded. Once it is uploaded, make sure that you have created
a database (MySQL/MySQLi/SQLite/PostgreSQL) and have assigned READ/WRITE/EXECUTE
permissions to the database user.

Once you have uploaded all of the files, use your FTP program to CHMOD the
following directories:

	upload/archive
	upload/tmp (this directory and all sub-directories)
	upload/includes/k4bb
	upload/templates/Descent/compiled
	upload/templates/Descent/admin/compiled
	upload/templates/Descent/admin/css/compiled

CHMOD all of these files with 0777 permissions.

Go to your website where you uploaded k4 BB and navigate to the install/index.php
Make sure you go to index.php and not just default to install/. Fill in the form
and click the submit button. If a critical error occures, go back and check that
all of the above directories have been CHMODed accordingly. If they are, the install
should be flawless.
