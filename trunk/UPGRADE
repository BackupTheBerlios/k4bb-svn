-- Beta 5 to Beta 6 --
Do generally the same as with b4 to b5. However, I suggest that you delete and reinsert all of the settings
(k4_settings table) that can be found in the k4.data.schema. Lot's has been added. Also, 16 new MAP items have
been added and using and upgrade script to add them would be annoying. I SUGGEST REINSTALLING.

-- Beta 4 to Beta 5 --
This is an untested upgrading script. The script can be found in upload/install/beta4_to_beta5.php in
the k4-2.0b5.zip file. Upload that file to k4 BB's root directory on your server and run it once! If you 
run it twice, it will fail miserable and bombard you with errors. To finalize your update, copy over
every file found in the above mentioned ZIP file (except config.php, which can be found in includes/k4bb)
and you should be good to go.
